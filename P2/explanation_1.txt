The solution for this problem to get O(log n) time complexity is to use a binary search.
A while loop allows this efficency because it only need to loop through the range of the 
number once but also narrows down the answer by not having to go through each item but
sorts it by // 2. For example 8 -> 4 (for answer 16) instead of 1 -> 2 -> 3 ect...
The space complexity is O(1).
