RouteTrieNode class as on overall complexity of O(1) where insert has O(1) time complexity.

RouteTrie class has and overall complexity of O(n) where insert has O(n) linear complexity
and find is also O(n) linear time complexity.

Router class has add_handler which does and insert from RouteTrie with a time complexity of O(n).
The lookup function uses find from RouteTrie which is O(n) time complexity. Which makes this class
have O(n) time complexity.

With O(n) being lowest complexity of any of the classes the overall complexity is O(n)
with a space complexity of O(1).
