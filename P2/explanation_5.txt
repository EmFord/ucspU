TrieNode class has and overall complexity of O(n) where insert has O(1) linear complexity
and suffixes is also O(n) linear time complexity.

Trie class has insert function with a time complexity of O(n). The find function is O(n) time complexity. 
Which makes this class have O(n) time complexity.

With O(n) being lowest complexity of any of the classes the overall complexity is O(n)
with a space complexity of O(1).
