In this problem I chose to use a dict as the cache structure because it has easy lookups that
are O(1) in complexity. I also utilzed a list to track the latest initlized items and remove the
oldest and shrink the list. All lines are O(1) time complexity. The space complexity of this
solution is O(n) with n being the number of items in the cache.
