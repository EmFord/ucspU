In this problem I have two for loops with a time complexity of O(n^k) because I have two dynamic
for loops. I would like to avoid the second for loop but did not know how to flatten the array
without doing so. This solution displays a use of recursion because it calls the funcntion within
itself. The space complexity for this solution is O(n) with n being the number of files to search.
